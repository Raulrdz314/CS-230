# CS-230

The Gaming Room client wanted a web-based application where users could input answers based on what they saw. Originally made for Android, the client wanted the app to be available to more users while staying within their budget. I think I did well in understanding the client’s needs and clearly outlining the requirements. This helped me create a simple and organized design that made it easier to develop the code. Writing pseudocode before coding was especially helpful because it allowed me to plan out my steps and avoid confusion.

One thing I would improve is the user interface section of my document. I would add wireframes or mockups to give a better visual idea of the design. I also focused a lot on the user’s perspective when working on the project. I kept asking how the user would interact with the app and made sure it would be easy to use and efficient. I learned that understanding user needs is very important because a design that doesn’t work for users will fail. In the future, I would use strategies like breaking the project into smaller steps, testing regularly, and creating wireframes to help make the design process clearer and more user-friendly.
